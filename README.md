```bash
devkits new-branch             # Create a new git branch
gitnew                         # Legacy: same as new-branch
```

## For New Joiners

This toolkit is designed to help new team members quickly discover and use development commands. Simply run `devkits` to start the interactive interface and explore available tools.

## Adding New Commands

To add a new command to the toolkit:

1. Create your script in the repository
2. Edit the `devkits` script and add your command to the `init_commands()` function:
   ```bash
   register_command "command-name" "Description" "$SCRIPT_DIR/your-script.sh" "Category"
   ```
3. Make sure your script is executable (`chmod +x your-script.sh`)

The command will automatically appear in the interactive interface and be searchable.
